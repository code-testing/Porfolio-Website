# Porfolio-Website
Website for hosting my portfolio for future employers
The purpose of this website, as stated above, is to create a place on the internet that I can show to future potential employers both my current coding projects as well as my progress with respect to both front-end and back-end development.  The goal of this github repository is to demonstrate an iterative process where the website grows both in size as well as complexity.  As such the first iterations of this website will first be purely HTML and CSS based and work more as a blog, where I will jot down my progress as well as be a place to display my various coding ideas/projects as they come to me.
