			<h1>Project Ideas</h1>
			<p>This will by my little spot where I jot down various programming projects that I might want to work
				on in the future</p>
			<h2>CLIPBOARD STACK/QUEUE</h2>
			<p>Have you ever had a series of objects you wanted to copy and paste? As of now you have to copy then
				paste, copy then paste, etc. What if we could copy a series of objects in order and then past them
				in that order? The question would be, should it be as a stack or a queue? I'm think queue at this
				point.
				<h2>GALLRI</h2>
				<p>Create an app/website that will host artist's works and provide a store where users can purchase
					originals/prints of their work.</p>
				<h2>MMORPG - World Domination</h2>
				<p>The goal for this game would be to dominate the entire world. Teams would need to develop and
					organize armies. Assinations would be allowed but the overall goal would be to control the
					entire map.</p>
				<h2>MOVING DOTS</h2>
				<p>JavaScript game. The goal is to click on the dot as many times as possible in an alotted time
					frame. The dot moves after every click and after a certain period of time. The dot also gets
					smaller after every click and changes position in a shorter time period as well.</p>
