				<h2>Blog Entry 1 - 12/21</h2>

				<p>So this is the begining of the whole process. Today is Monday December 21, 2020. We are still in the
					middle of a pandemic and I am stillin the middle of my Computer Science degree. I do have a new 3
					month old baby girl in my life! MY daughter's name is Shelby Grace and yes, I will be featuring
					pictures and videos of her at some point!</P>
				<p>So I do have some skills at this point with respect to HMTL and CSS and I have had to build some
					fairly simple website for classes in the past but I have been focusing on C++ and Solidity so my
					HTML and CSS skills have languished a bit. This blog/website should hopefully get all of that back
					up to snuff. Plus this will be a great reason to hone my skills in mysql and javascript!</p>
				<p>As of now, I am just typing all of this into a Notepad file and will eventully port everything over
					to Eclipse so I can work on fancier aspects of the site. But for now, since this is a no frills
					page, plain text will work.</p>
				<h2>Blog Entry 2 - 12/21</h2>
				<p>I have added a CSS file to this html page and set all "p" tags to red as a test of my super advanced
					css skills. I plan to organize and build this out further later tonight so we can get a web page
					that doesn't look like an even more primitive version of the Drudge Report...</p>
				<h2>Blog Entry 3 - 12/22</h2>
				<p>SO today I have decided to work on using the div tag and creating a more compartmenalized layout to
					the website. This is website building 101 and will start giving the website less of a "created by a
					5th grader" look to it. I breifly dipped my toes into the div tag yesterday by adding a black
					boarder around the title of the website but that was just to create some sort of separation. Now
					it's time to actually focus on layout today...</p>
				<h2>Blog Entry 4 - 12/22</h2>
				<p>I have added div tags to the website title, intro section, blog section, and the project ideas
					section. I've added some color as well to create a bit of contrast. Since I don't have any specific
					colors in mind I simply went with hex numbers and setting either the red, green, or blue to zero.
					Currently, it looks like a clown is designing this thing. This will improve as the website
					progresses.</p>

				<h2>Blog Entry 5 - 12/22</h2>
				<p>I have dipped my feat into incorporating JavaScript into the site. Now we have a JavaScript title
					underneath the actual website title. I will work on doing goofy stuff with it for the time being as
					I get more used to working with JavaScript. As of now it just displays the content from the
					javascript file.</p>

				<h2>Blog Entry 6 - 12/23</h2>
				<p>Today I plan on doing more work on both javascript as well as the overall layout of the website. At
					some point in time I would like to incorporate a way to store these bolg posts in a database and
					have them populate dynamically. Something to research for the coming days...</p>

				<h2>Blog Entry 7 - 12/23</h2>
				<p>I have made some pretty interesting changes to the site. Instead of having just div containers for
					each section going down one after the other, I have set up the blog posts and the Project Ideas next
					to each other and added a scroll bar for each one. Eventually I will probably add a feature to skip
					to the bottom for the blog posts since who wants to read old posts? I have also added a canvas to
					the JavaScript section for practice. My goal is to create a simple game where try and click on as
					many dots as possible in an alloted time frame. The dot moves after every click and gets smaller and
					smaller. I think there will also be a time limit to click on the dot before it moves as well.</p>

				<h2>Blog Entry 8 - 12/23</h2>
				<p>I've made some pretty good progress today on this site. I was able to get the canvas up and running.
					Added some javascript to create a bunch of dots. Doing that is the first step in putting together
					that small game I had in mind. I also applied the fade in feature to the intro text, which took a
					little bit to get set up but it ended up looking pretty cool. I'm excited to use this feature at
					some point in the future as I build this site out into a professional and respectable one. I'm
					starting to take a look at other sites that I might want emulate/steal and I'm getting some ideas
					about it. But for now, it's still a bit of a clown show and that's ok. It's been fun dusting off the
					old HMTL, CSS, and JavaScript skills and actually putting them to use instead of just creating
					websites for class projects.</p>

				<h2>Blog Entry 9 - 12/24</h2>
				<p>I've read up on the Canvas element and the various options you can use to alter it. My plan today is
					to start on the Dot clicking game. For an intitial version I will need to a) create a a dot on a
					canvas that will move to a random spot b) create an event listener that listens for a mouse click c)
					made the dot respond to a mouse click on it d) create a timer that will refresh the canvas after a
					certain countdown e) reset the timer on a successful click f) create a counter for successful
					clicks. Most of these seem doable in a days worth of fiddling.</p>

				<h2>Blog Entry 10 - 12/24</h2>
				<p>I've created the new canvas for the game and have written the javascript code to create a dot and
					have it move to a random spot on the board after a few seconds. I'm still working on reducing the
					time between position changes over time but I should be able to find the info I need after a little
					bit of googling. I have also read up on adding gradients to the layout. I've added it to everything
					so while it looks less like a clown show, it now looks like a 6th grader who just discovered
					gradients and went to town in MS Paint. I'll work on making that look a bit fancier and I want to
					fiddle with how the scroll bars look. Eventually I'm going to add links to other pages and make this
					look much more professional but I'm still having fun refreshing my HTML and CSS skills. Practice
					makes perfect! I think this weekend I'm going to move everything over to eclipse. It will be easier
					to update github and allow for refactoring. The site has gotten large enough where it has become a
					bit of a pain to make chagnes across the board.</p>

				<h2>Blog Entry 11 - 12/28</h2>
				<p>After a nice long Christmas break it is time to get back to work on the website. I think today I will
					focus on the layout of the site, start researching ways to put these posts on a server running mysql
					and how to create a spot to post to. I also will be looking into creating a timer for my javascript
					game, a counter for correct clicks, and a way to click on the dot so that it is recognized. Lots to
					do today and I doubt I'll be able to get it all done since it looks like my acutal job will be
					fairly busy despite the fact that it's the final week of the year. Oh well, that's part of the fun!
				</p>

				<h2>Blog Entry 12 - 12/28</h2>
				<p>I am also going to pot everything over to Eclipse at some point today. Using just notepad and the
					browser's IDE to make changes to the various files has grown a bit teadious and is causing a
					noticable slow down in progress.</p>

				<h2>BLog Entry 13 - 12/28</h2>
				<p>Sucess! I have, after many updates, gotten my projet hooked up to github through eclipse. Now I can
					edit at a faster rate and keep everything nice and formated at the same time. Sometimes it's the
					little things that make your day. I am still working on the javascript game and will need to do a
					little research with resecpt to event listeners in the context of the canvas. There appear to be
					some good tutorials on line regarding it and there is always the wild wild west, a/k/a
					StackOverflow... I can now really start to work on the layout of the site and start to flesh out
					various pages to move content to. I will probably move blog to a separate page, as well as the
					project ideas, and javascript work page. I think the landing page will be designed to look a little
					more professional. I will start to add pictures to the whole deal and look for an intersting font
					library. Arial just does grab a viewer like it should.</p>

				<h2>Blog Entry 14 - 12/29</h2>
				<p>I think I have a good idea for an overall theme to the style of the website. What if I made a website
					that looked like a white board? Kinda cool, I think! I think it might be cool to let the user write
					on the page as well. So it might be cool to let them use different color markers and let them erase
					stuff as well. Perhaps as I get the hand of things I might want to figure out if there is an easy
					way to recognize what was written and then covert it but that may just be a bit too complex at the
					moment. Right now, I am still trying to fiugre out how to load a third-part font that I found from
					google that looks like a marker being used on a whiteboard. Once I get that working, I think I will
					revamp the whole site and add a whiteboard image as the background and then overlay all text on a
					transparaent background.</p>

				<h2>Blog Entry 15 - 12/29</h2>
				<p>I have also made some pretty drastic chages to the layout at this point. I have added the blog,
					javascript work, and project ideas sections to their own separate pages and linked them from the
					home page. And I have made that into a menu on the home page. I need to figure out how to make that
					menu bar a permanent fixture on all pages. Still lots of work to do on this site!</p>

				<h2>Blog Entry 16 - 12/29</h2>
				<p>I have fired up the ol' mysql server and set up a simpe database in preparation of handling blog
					entries. At the moment it will just feature the blog entry number, data of posting, and the
					narrative. I will evenatually add the capability to add pictures or videos to the database so it is
					more akin to a legitamite blog but I'm going to get the easy text stuff out of the way first.</p>

				<h2>Blog Entry 17 - 12/29</h2>
				<p>At the moment I think it might be a good idea just to make a list of all the various things I am
					working on for the website and the protfolio in general:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Find out how to add permanent marker font to site</li>
					<li>Find whiteboard image to give appearance that this is being desinged by hand</li>
					<li>Figure out how to use apache</li>
					<li>Figure out how to use PHP to post blog entries</li>
					<li>Work on JavaScript game - I will need to organize it on paper at this point</li>
					<li>Research more CSS styles to make the site more aesthetically intersting</li>
					<li>Get the menu bar to fill the who page</li>
					<li>Get title and menu bar to stay on every page</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Blog Entry 18 - 12/30</h2>
				<p>Not much progress was done on my bullet points yesterday. After work, it was baby time so I wasn't
					able to really keep much focus. Plus the 3 hours of sleep from the night before made it difficult to
					do anything but run on autopilot. I got a little more sleep last night so hopefully today will go a
					little bit better. I think today I will try and focus on:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Getting the third-party font library to acutally load</li>
					<li>Read up on how to use apache and get it to work with the mysql server hosting my database</li>
					<li>Pull out pen and paper to acutally design my jacascript game and then begin to code that.</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Blog Entry 19 - 12/31/20</h2>
				<p>Did some research yesterday regarding Apache but all in all didn't get much done. Hopefully I wil
					be able to do more today but since I've got family stopping by, I'm not too confident that will
					happen. Oh well... I've got a three-day weekend coming up so hopefully I will find time to work
					on things. I will try and do more with respect to the the JavaScript game. I think I can get a
					rough draft written today at some point.</p>

				<h2>Blog Entry 20 - 1/6/21</h2>
				<p>Happy New Year! I decided to take some time away from this and focus on Shelby and my wife. But I am
					back at it today! I will be doing more mysql refreshing today with the hope that I can start
					creating a PHP file to add these entries to a database that can then be fetched. We will see though!
				</p>

				<h2>Blog Entry 21 - 1/6/21</h2>
				<p>I have added a form at the top which I will soon use to add blog entries to the website.
					Before I get that finished I will need to move all blog entries over to the mysql database
					that I set up for the website and I will need to work on the PHP file that I will use to
					access the database, pull the various entries, and post them to the website dynamically. I will also
					need to work on the CSS for the form so it matches the rest of the website's still work in process
					asthetic.</p>

				<h2>Blog Entry 22 - 1/6/21</h2>
				<p>So after doing some PHP study and building the HTML I ended up doing some actual work and came across
					my issue with the clipboard function again. It looks like someone has already thought about what I
					was thinking about and built it into Windows. So I will now have to go in and strike through the
					code project idea...</p>

				<h2>Blog Entry 23 - 1/7/21</h2>
				<p>I'm still going through reading up on PHP at the moment. I'm still kinda bummed about the clipbaord
					thing but it is nice to know that I was thinking about fixing an issue in what appears to be the
					same way that Microsoft did. It still would be a cool idea to look further into the clipboard API
					and see how it works. Too bad they don't actually show their source code for it... </p>

				<h2>Blog Entry 24 - 1/7/21</h2>
				<p>Like a fat kid with ADHD who just ate a shit-ton of cake, I have decided to change tacs yet again and
					earn a couple of web developer related certificates. It think it will help:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Help refresh my HTML/CSS/Javascript knowledge</li>
					<li>Give me some possible design ideas to further flesh out my portfolio website</li>
					<li>Look good on my resume</li>
				</ol>
				<p>Hopefully I will be able to knock these certificates out pretty quickly. I still need to go back and
					finish up my Calculus refresh as well for my upcoming Calc 2 course this summer. I have refreshed on
					differential calculus and I need to finish up on Integral calc. Plus I want to try and learn as much
					as possible for calc 2 before I actually take the class. The last thing I need to deal with is a
					tough course and a growing baby! I'm going to take three classes in the summer and that's a fair
					amount even without a child to take care of.</p>
