		<p>This is the very first iteration of my portfolio website.</p>

		<p>Over the next several months, my goal is to gradually evolve this website into a more professional one greater use of back-end features as well as creating a more asthetically please interface.</p>
		<p>This is Iteration 1</p>

		<p>Blog Entry 1 - 12/21</P>

		<p>So this is the begining of the whole process.  Today is Monday December 21, 2020.  We are still in the middle of a pandemic and I am stillin the middle of my Computer Science degree.  I do have a new 3 month old baby girl in my life!  MY daughter's name is Shelby Grace and yes, I will be featuring pictures and videos of her at some point!</P>
		<p>So I do have some skills at this point with respect to HMTL and CSS and I have had to build some fairly simple website for classes in the past but I have been focusing on C++ and Solidity so my HTML and CSS skills have languished a bit.  This blog/website should hopefully get all of that back up to snuff.  Plus this will be a great reason to hone my skills in mysql and javascript!</P>
		<p>As of now, I am just typing all of this into a Notepad file and will eventully port everything over to Eclipse so I can work on fancier aspects of the site.  But for now, since this is a no frills page, plain text will work.</p>
		<p>Project Ideas</p>
		<p>This will by my little spot where I jot down various programming projects that I might want to work on in the future</p>
		<p>CLIPBOARD STACK/QUEUE<p>
		<p>Have you ever had a series of objects you wanted to copy and paste?  As of now you have to copy then paste, copy then paste, etc.  What if we could copy a series of objects in order and then past them in that order?  The question would be, should it be as a stack or a queue?  I'm think queue at this point.
		<p>GALLRI</p>
		<p>Create an app/website that will host artist's works and provide a store where users can purchase originals/prints of their work.</p<
		<p>MMORPG - World Domination</p>
		<p>The goal for this game would be to dominate the entire world.  Teams would need to develop and organize armies.  Assinations would be allowed but the overall goal would be to control the entire map.</p>
