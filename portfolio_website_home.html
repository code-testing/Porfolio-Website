		<p>This is the very first iteration of my portfolio website.</p>

		<p>Over the next several months, my goal is to gradually evolve this website into a more professional one greater use of back-end features as well as creating a more asthetically please interface.</p>
		<p>This is Iteration 1</p>

		<p>Blog Entry 1 - 12/21</P>

		<p>So this is the begining of the whole process.  Today is Monday December 21, 2020.  We are still in the middle of a pandemic and I am stillin the middle of my Computer Science degree.  I do have a new 3 month old baby girl in my life!  MY daughter's name is Shelby Grace and yes, I will be featuring pictures and videos of her at some point!</P>
		<p>So I do have some skills at this point with respect to HMTL and CSS and I have had to build some fairly simple website for classes in the past but I have been focusing on C++ and Solidity so my HTML and CSS skills have languished a bit.  This blog/website should hopefully get all of that back up to snuff.  Plus this will be a great reason to hone my skills in mysql and javascript!</P>
		<p>As of now, I am just typing all of this into a Notepad file and will eventully port everything over to Eclipse so I can work on fancier aspects of the site.  But for now, since this is a no frills page, plain text will work.</p>
